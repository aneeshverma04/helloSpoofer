VoIP(Voice Over Internet Protocol) is the core concept behind Call Spoofing.

In traditional POTS(Plain old telephone system) caller id is passed using FSK(Frequency shift keying) during the first and 2nd rings of a call.
In mobile phones or normal caller id phones, FSK is done by telephone providers.

However in Business phone systems or VOIP phone systems responsibility of caller id lies on who initiated the call and not the one who receives it. Therefore easy to spoof.
These VOIP systems are given access to the PRI(Primary Rate Interface) for telephony network. Instead of FSK been done by telephone providers it is done by PBX(Private Branch Exchange),
basically the person who is making the outbound call.

There are several reasons for making PBX incharge including: 
DID(Direct Inward Dialing) = assigning every single VOIP phone its own legitimate phone number. So e.g., for an employee making a sales call, the company's phone number will
appear on customer's caller ID, rather than employee's DID number.

Now anyone can get access to PRI very cheaply through a VOIP provider and run a free and open source PBX system like Asterisk.

IMPORTANT TERMINOLOGIES:
1. PBX (Private Branch Exchange) = A private telephone network, used within a company or an organization. e.g., ASTERISK, 3CX etc.
2. DISA (Direct Inward System Access) = This is sort of like VPN’ing to your internal system, so you can dial internal extensions.
3. DID (Direct Inward Dialing) = This is the telephone number assigned by your service provider. Analogous to an external IP address, but for telephony.
4. Trunk = In the PSTN/PBX world, there are two kinds of lines: local loop vs trunk. A local loop is what runs between the telco central office and your house,
           and it can only carry one call at a time (2 if you had call waiting, but only one at a time). A trunk is a digital circuit (T1 or E1 PRI) that can carry
           multiple calls at one time using TDM (time-division multiplexing). Trunks run between telco central offices and switching centers because it wouldn't be very 
           efficient to have individual lines for every single call path.
5. SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) = The standard for VoIP communication, and used for negotiations when making connections. It is a protocol used for defining communication 
                                        between two endpoints.            
6. SIP Trunk = A SIP trunk is a virtual trunk between two SIP enabled systems. It is used to send voice traffic from one system to another. It’s basically a virtual telephone
                connection. It effectively creates a virtual ‘cable’ between a PBX and the  Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)                                        

Asterisk is a software implementation of a private branch exchange (PBX).
Don't worry if you cannot understand all these terminologies completely. Just have a vague idea what a PBX and a SIP Trunk is.

Legality of Call Spoofing varies from country to country so please see the legal status before attempting anything.
