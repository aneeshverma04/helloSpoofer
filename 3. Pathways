 There are different ways of setting up the VoIP calls:
 1. Install Asterisk/Other_PBX in your linux distro and use a softphone.
 2. Install FreePBX VM in which Asterisk comes pre installed, do the settings and use a softphone.
 3. Use certain softphones like microsip and Zoiper in which no installation needs to be done, just enter your SIP Trunk details.(recommended)
 4. Use mobile apps of certain SIP providers where you just have to scan a QR or something like that.
 
 I tried way 1, 2 and 3. 
 Installing Asterisk certainly takes time and effort however port 5060 on which Asterisk runs is blocked most of the times. I changed IPTABLES settings, disabled firewall,
 did everything i could but the port didn't open. If someone holds the key of opening the port hmu :) .
 
 Installing FREEPBX was painfree and Asterisk comes preinstalled. There are numerous tutorials on youtube on how to configure FREEPBX after installing on youtube.
 
 Choosing better softphones like microsip and zoiper will get the work done easily and efficiently. No need of suffering with installations or errors.
 
 I was able to do spoof calling(to friends in US and Canada, because that's what my SIP Trunk allowed) without a problem with microsip.
