As said earlier we will be using ringplan as a SIP Trunk.

Make an account on ringplan. The phone number you give will appear as caller id to other person unless you mask it using PBX. No phone verification is there so no problems.
After doing the initial settings, goto extensions> show QR code.
With QR code you can use the mobile app to make calls.
OR use the following details to enter in PBX or PBX configured softphone.
Server address	
Server user	
Password	
Proxy	

In microsip you can just enter these details and VIOLA!! you are done.
Enter:
SIP Server as Server address
SIP Proxy as Proxy
Username as Server user
Domain as SIP Server
Login as Server user
Password as Password.

You can now make VoIP calls.

Process is even easier in Zoiper.

If doing manually using asterisk you need to enter these details in sip.conf inside Asterisk folder. Please take help of someone you know in VoIP for configurations or follow
VoIP forums.
Example configuration:

[sip trunk]
username=[Server User]
type=peer
secret=[Password]
qualify=yes
nat=force_rport
host=[SIP Server]
dtmfmode=rfc2833
canreinvite=no
disallow=all
allow=g722
allow=ulaw
insecure=port,invite

You will also need to configure the registration string and outbound proxy.

Again I was unsuccessful in opening the 5060 port so I am not sure if the configurations I did in sip.conf and extenions.conf is correct. If you don't face port problems,
you can follow the forums. You will find a lot of sample configurations.
