If you go down the manual route. Following are the steps to install Asterisk:

Install Ubuntu
Network Adapter from NAT to Bridge

cd /usr/src
wget http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/certified-asterisk/asterisk-certified-16.8-current.tar.gz
tar -zxvf asterisk-certified-16.8-current.tar.gz
cd asterisk-certified-16.8-cert8

sudo su
apt install build-essential
apt install libxml2-dev
apt install libncurses5-dev libreadline-dev libreadline6-dev
apt install libssl-dev
apt install uuid-dev
apt install libjansson-dev
apt install libsqlite3-dev
apt install pkg-config
apt-get install -y libedit-dev

/*
At this point we need to select the SIP library we are going to use in Asterisk. SIP is basically VoIP protocol that we MUST have in asterisk. 
Version 13 of Asterisk is a little awkward because it can use either “PJSIP” (a 3rd party library) or it’s native built in SIP library.
The Asterisk team is encouraging people to use “PJSIP” instead of the native SIP library, so in Asterisk 13 PJSIP is the default library, but on
Ubuntu 14 PJSIP must be installed and compiled from source.
*/

Install PJSIP:
cd /usr/src
wget https://codeload.github.com/pjsip/pjproject/tar.gz/2.10
tar -xvf 2.10
cd pjproject-2.10
./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-shared --disable-sound --disable-resample --disable-video --disable-opencore-amr CFLAGS='-O2 -DNDEBUG'
make dep && make && make install 
ldconfig


Go back to your asterisk directory and “./configure” then continue to then continue to compile & install instructions.

cd ../certified-asterisk-13.1-cert2/
